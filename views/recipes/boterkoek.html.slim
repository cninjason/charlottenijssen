    h1.recipe-title Dutch butter cake
    .recipe-intro
      p This recipe is incredibly easy to make and really quite different to sponges and pound cakes.
      p Dense and buttery, it is very comforting, though perhaps not the most sophisticated or diet-friendly of bakes.
      p But then again, who wants to count calories when there is cake involved?

          | Instructions
        p Preheat the oven to 180C. Beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then add the egg and salt. Lastly, stir in the flour and mix well.
        p Grease a square (or round) cake tin and add the batter. It will be a bit tough and sticky, but try to spread and smooth it down with the back of a spoon.
        p Brush the top with beaten egg, and then use a knife to create a pretty pattern (as you can see, mine is usually "rustic abstract fields").
        p Bake the cake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top is a nice golden brown. Leave to cool completely before you cut it into squares or slices.
