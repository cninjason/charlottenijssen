    h1.recipe-title Raspberry buttermilk cakes
    .recipe-intro
      p One thing I love about living in Germany is the easy access to buttermilk. I always keep a pint of it in the fridge in case I feel the urge to make biscuits or scones.
      p Buttermilk is what makes these cakes lovely and moist, but nevertheless surprisingly fluffy.
      p Make sure you don't bruise the raspberries when you press them into the batter, as you don't want them to bleed and release too much moisture.

          | Instructions
        p Preheat the oven to 200C and line a 12 cup cake tin with paper liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and set aside.
        p Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then mix in the vanilla and egg.
        p Now turn the mixer to a low speed and add the flour in batches, alternating with the buttermilk. Keep mixing until well combined.
        p Divide the mixture into the cups (I love using an ice cream scoop for this), and then gently push about 3 raspberries into each cup.
        p Sprinkle the tops with the remaining sugar and bake the cakes for about 25 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.
        p While the cakes are cooling one a wire rack, gently melt the chocolate and drizzle it over the cooled cakes.
